Data mining - we discuss knowledge discovery from Data, it includes knowing about data, finding relations between data and for this we need to discuss data objects and attributes


Data preprocessing
the first step is to identify the type of attributes , we differentiate between different types of attributes and the preprocess the data
Here is the description of attribute types
1. Qualitative (Nominal(N), Ordinal(O), Binary(B))
2. Quantitative (Numeric, Discrete, Continuous)

Nominal - names of things
Binary - has only two values/states eg yes/no true/false male/female
Ordinal - contains values that have meaningful sequence or ranking order betwwn them eg A-Z 
NUmeric - integer or real values.
